Display modern job board on any post or page of your website by adding the shortcode provided. Add top listings from our biggest international directory. We have jobs in 79 countries.

== Description ==

Very light weight, very easy to use plugin which will add job listings to your website in 79 different countries. Clean interface, job role and town selection.

The plugin adds embedded block which will take suitable space fitted in your WordPress theme to list upto 15 jobs listings on the page.
You can really select how much jobs do you want to list on some page, all else job we have will be splitted to other pages to fit all inventory ;)
You can see that all on screens 5 and 6. 

You can see on screen 2 for example that you can select default starting jobe role to start search with. 
Also you can obviously select town (not the country YET) right in the page and do new search by clicking "Find Jobs"

== Multilingual - multicountry ==

See screenshots 7 and 8, on 7 you even have preview option for all that thing, also you shouldn't make mistake and enter country name, but country code like DE here.
It may varies, country and languagem, check our site for more details. For supported countries also visit site or simply checkout screen 8. 
As you may notice you may also preview whole shortcode before placing it on the page to see if you set correctly every meaning of whole block [jobs]
